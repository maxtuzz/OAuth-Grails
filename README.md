# OAuth-Grails
Demonstration of OAuth+Grails being used to authenticate with social services.
Developed to work with OLD versions of Grails (2.0.3) and Java 6 in order to comply with existing legacy systems.

This example will also work fine with up-to-date versions of Grails and Java.

###Third-part services demonstrated:
* Facebook
* Twitter
* LinkedIn

###Installation: 
* Configure Grails to match version used in this example - 2.0.3. (That or create your own grails app and copy over relevant source files etc. etc.)
* Set JDK to 1.6 for this example to run (again - it's up to you if you create your own project from this example) 
* Navigate to config.groovy and enter in corresponding API-keys and secret-keys. 
* Run with `grails run-app` or with IDE of your choice

###Disclaimer
Uses [OAuth Plugin for Grails](http://grails.org/plugin/oauth)
